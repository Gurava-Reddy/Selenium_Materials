Smoke Testing:
Smoke Testing is done to make sure if the build we received from the development team is testable or not. It is also called as “Day 0”.
We will execute only the basic flows or functionalities. Smoke testing will be done for 3-4 hours on the day when we receive the build.(Version1.0)

Sanity: 

Sanity Testing is done during the release phase and in case I receive an updated build with newly added features.

We will check the main functionalities of the application without going deeper and also will check the newly added feature.

This will be done for 3-4 hours on the day when we receive the newly updated build.(Version2.0)

Regression:

Repeated testing of an already tested program, after modification, to discover any defects introduced due to newly added feature is called Regression testing.

Regression testing is done on the below scenarios:

a. New functionalities are added to the application
b. Change Requirement (In organizations, we call it as CR)
c. Defect Fixing
d. Performance Issue Fix
e. Environment changes
