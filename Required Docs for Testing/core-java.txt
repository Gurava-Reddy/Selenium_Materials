==========================================
JDK:
----
*Java Development Kit.
*If we want to run any applications in java we need JDK have to installed.
*JDK versions: 1.0 to 1.10.
JRE: ---- *Java Runtime Environment. *It is a pre-defined class files (i.e.) library files. JVM:
----
*Java Virtual Machine.
*It is mainly used to allocate the memory and compiling.
8.What is mean by oops?
=======================
*OOPS is Object Oriented Programing Structure.
*OOPS is a method of implementation in which programs are organized as collection of objects, class and methods.
9.What are the coding Standard used in java?
=============================================
*Pascal notation: Each and every word of the first letter should be in capital. Example:GreensTechnology
*Camel notation: First word should be small after every word of the first letter should be capital. Example:greensTechnology
10.What is mean by class,method,object?
=======================================
Class:
------
*Class is nothing but collection of methods or collection of objects. Method:
-------
*Method is nothing but set of action to be performed.
Object:
-------
*Object is the run time memory allocation.
*Using object we call the any methods.
11.What is mean by Encapsulation?
=================================
*It is the structure of creating folders.

(i.e) if both parent class having same method name it will get priority problem so it doesn't work in java.
23.What are the difference between Multiple and Multilevel inheritance?
=======================================================================
Multiple inheritance:
---------------------
*Combination of more then one parent class directly supported one child class.
*It wont work in java due to priority problem.
Multilevel inheritance:
-----------------------
*Combination of more than one parent class and child class using tee level structure.
*It work in java.
24.What is mean by access specifier?
====================================
*It decides the level of access to the variable,method and class.
25.What are the difference between public and protected?
========================================================
Public:
-------
*It is global level access( same package + different package).
Protected:
----------
*Inside package + outside Package (Extends).
26.What is mean by Abstraction?

2.Fully abstraction(interface).
28.Can we create Object for Abstract class?
===========================================
*No, we cant create object for abstract class.
29.What is mean by Interface?

*It using implements keywords.
30.What are the difference between Abstract and Interface?
==========================================================
Abstract class:
---------------
*It is partially abstraction.
*It support both abstract method and non-abstract method.
*It’s using "extends" keyword.
*Here "public abstract" have to mention.
*We can use whatever access specifier we want.
Interface:
----------
*It is fully abstraction.
*It support only abstract method.

38.Why a return type is not allowed for constructor?
====================================================
*constructor is not directly called by your code, its calle by memory allocation and object initialisation inthe run time.

50.What is mean by static method?
=================================
*Static method in java belong to the class(not to an object).
*They use no instance variables and will usually take the input from the parameters and perform action on it,then return some result. 
51.What is mean by final keyword and what's happend when we declare final as in class,method,variable?
========================================================================================================
*Final is a non access modifier applicable only to a variable,a method or a class.
